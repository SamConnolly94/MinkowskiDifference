# MinkowskiDifference
This is a demonstration of using the Minkowski Difference to idetify if two shapes intersect. It is developed in a console application and purposefully minimalistic.

## Usage
Add your own shapes to the tests file and check whether various shapes will intercept or not.

## Future Notes
This currently does not support concave shapes, although it could be expanded to. I'd also like to take this a bit further and implement the GJK algorithm, as I got a bit carried away and most of the support functions are now present for it already.
